Analysis of IBB Istanbul Weather and Traffic Dataset
====================================================

This project is an analysis of the Istanbul Weather and Traffic Dataset provided by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. The dataset contains information on traffic density and weather conditions in Istanbul over a period of several years.

The project is broken down into the following steps:

1.  **Data Collection:** The raw data is obtained from the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and is in CSV format.
    
2.  **Data Cleaning:** The raw data is cleaned using Python and the Pandas library. The data is inspected for any missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. The cleaned data is then stored in a new CSV file.
    
3.  **Data Analysis:** The cleaned data is then used to analyze traffic patterns and weather trends in Istanbul. Various statistical methods and data visualization techniques are used to gain insights into the data.
